Image Steganography Project using Python

The image Hidden.png is encoded and hidden inside the image Carrier.jpg using Encode.py.
From this Python program we get Encoded_image.png.
This Encoded_image.png is then decoded using Decode.py to obtain the image Decoded_image.png which is the same as Hidden.png.
